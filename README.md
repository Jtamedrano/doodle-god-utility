# doodle-god-utility

The game, 'Doodle God', has the player start with typically 4 basic elements. The user would select to elements and try to combine them and make a new element. It is the users goal to try all possible solutions until there are no more new elements to create.

Playing this game, I would write down my attempts, I would study the recepie guide within the game to see if an attempt of the combination was already made, I would even try to write down all the possible solutions for each element. I decided to make an app that would find all the possible solutions, without giving me the answers, and also track my previous attempts. Try Doodle God Utility with the Game Doodle God, or any other similar game.
